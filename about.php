        <h2>Report</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>What tasks have you not attempted or not completed?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was able to attempt and complete all tasks including the extra challenge.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know
                    about?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have used CSS styling in a way that it automatically resizes elements for different screen
                        orientations which enhances responsiveness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Which parts did you have trouble with?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>One particular challenge was managing the session variables between the pages.</li>
                    <li>Another challenge was trying to get the SQL queries right because they got complicated
                        sometimes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>What would you like to do better next time?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maybe fill the screen with more elements to improve the UI.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>What additional features did you add to the assignment?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In order to view user's friend list or to add friends, the user has to be logged in. So if they
                        aren't logged in, they
                        are first taken to login.php and then to the respective page. This functionality can be tested
                        from this page itself using
                        the Friend list and Add Friends buttons at the bottom of the screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>The implementation of responsive CSS features.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
